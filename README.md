# Projects

Here's a list of companies and projects I have worked on:

* [The Daily Spin](https://dailyspin.co/) - The Daily Spin is a cycling news aggregator, built with Python, Django2, Elasticsearch, Redis, Postgres. It's a passion project in regular development.
* [SimonDell.com](https://simondell.com) - Marketing consultancy and my primary focus.
* [Hilenium](https://hilenium.com/) - Currently a marketing-optimised performance host, but was originally a B2B marketing management app. 
* [Hilenium App](https://app.hilenium.com/) - No longer in active development but it's still being used by a few clients. Built with Symfony, Redis, Algolia and MySQL.
* Hilenium iOS App - No longer maintained. Written in Swift. I am particularly proud of this app... I love Swift.
* [Pelofy](https://pelofy.com) - Ride planning application for cyclists. We released a well received beta and had thousands of registrations, but we quickly realised we'd be poor forever trying to complete with FB :(
